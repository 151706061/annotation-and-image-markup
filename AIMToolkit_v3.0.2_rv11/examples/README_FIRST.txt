AIM Examples (version 3, revision 11)

This directory contains samples of five DICOM images baseline and followup
along with AIM XML instances.

Images are located at:

 .\SampleAIMAnnotationsAndImages\Images\Baseline 
 .\SampleAIMAnnotationsAndImages\Images\Follow-up

AMI XML Instances are located at:

 .\SampleAIMAnnotationsAndImages\AIMAnnotations\Baseline 
 .\SampleAIMAnnotationsAndImages\AIMAnnotations\Follow-up

There are two XSD files, AIM_v3_rv11_XML.xsd and AIM_v3_rv11_Model.xsd.

AIM_v3_rv11_Model.xsd is a XML schema based on AIM model that contains 
bi-directionality. It is used for AIM data service. This schema will 
validate AIM XML documents generated by AIM_v3_rv11_XML.xsd.

AIM_v3_rv11_XML.xsd is XML schema that does not contains bi-directionality.
It has two root elements ImageAnnotation and AnnotationOfAnnotation. It is 
a subset of AIM_v3_rv11_Model.xsd. We use AIM_v3_rv11_XML.xsd to generate
official AIM XML documents.

a separate tool that converts AIM XML document to AIM HL7 CDA.
